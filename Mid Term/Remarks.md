## Remarks

Dear Rahul, your midterm report titled ‘Understanding the Business Purview of a Grocery Firm’ has been evaluated, and it has been accepted under the assumption that you would hard work for the final submission. These are detailed comments. 1. Recommendations would not be in the part of the midterm submission. It will be the part of final submission. Include the data-driven findings finding here. Furthermore, I would recommend collecting more data to get better insights. 2. Proof of originality: it is okay. 3. Metadata and descriptive statistics: it is not properly explained. Typically, all the variables need to be put in the table with proper units followed by a detailed explanation. Furthermore, include the count considered while estimating the mean. Also, include the median and std. dev. and elucidate them. 4. Method: here you have mentioned the count, which is too low for the detailed analysis. In this section, a detailed discussion on data collection, preprocessing, and feasible approaches to address the challenges would be required. Conciseness is lacking here. 5. Results and findings: Pareto is wrong. Additionally, you do not have sufficient SKUs to show the proper Pareto so include more SKUs. You have compared the sold and purchase quantity only for one month, which is again not enough to get details. 6. I would recommend collecting more data and adhering to the rubrics while drafting the final report. Best wishes!
