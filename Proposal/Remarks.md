## Remarks

The executive summary lacks specific details about how the data analysis will be conducted. The executive summary should provide an overview of your work, including details like how you will collect data and the specific methods you will use. Avoid using the first person in sentences. The organization's background section lacks important operational details like the number of employees or financial figures. The Problem Solving Approach section needs significant improvements in structure and clarity. First, the section should be clearly organized under three subheadings: method, data, and tools, with justifications. Currently, the approach lacks specific analysis techniques for each problem identified, such as inefficient inventory management, material wastage, and competition from online platforms. You need to clearly explain the methods that will be applied, for example, using time-series analysis for inventory management or regression models for sales forecasting. Additionally, while you mention analyzing the "top five best-selling products," the rationale behind choosing only five products is not explained. Clarify why these five products were selected and how they are representative of the shop's overall sales. Furthermore, the section lacks details on the data collection process: specify where the data will come from (e.g., sales records, purchase invoices), how it will be collected (e.g., through direct access to shop records or surveys), and the time period it will cover (e.g., the last 12 months). It's important to outline these details to ensure that the analysis is based on accurate and relevant data. For Material Wastage Management, you mentioned general recommendations like using weight-checking machines or managing free tastings. However, instead of providing these operational suggestions, you should focus on how data analysis can be leveraged to address the wastage issue. First, you need to collect specific data on wastage, such as the amount of product lost during packaging, the frequency of free tastings, and instances of spillage. The method you can use for this analysis includes time-series analysis to track wastage trends over time and identify periods with higher wastage. Additionally, you could employ regression analysis to determine the factors contributing most to wastage, such as the type of product, staff handling, or customer behaviour. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) should be presented in diagram form. Additionally, the dates in the Gantt chart are incorrect. The timeline shows the project running from October 10th to November 3rd, but the proposal was submitted in December, so these dates do not align with the actual project timeline.
