## Remarks

Focus on the methodology, technicalities of the analysis like if you're doing time-series so understand the modelling, acf and pacf plots and what it's parameters represent.

Or if you're using some other techniques like regression or classification then know about the inner workings of the model.

And focus more on the findings and recommendations part !!
